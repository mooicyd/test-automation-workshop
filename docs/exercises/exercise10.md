# Exercise 10: Updating the Backend

Let's work on the first user story:

- [ ] `AC-1`: **Backend** API endpoint (`POST /todos/clear-completed`) to clear completed To Do Tasks.

Skip to the portion for your preferred programming language:

- [JavaScript](#javascript)
- [Python](#python)
- [Java](#java)

## JavaScript

### Updating the Unit Test

1. In the **"Backend App"** workspace, open the test file: `test/todoRoutes.test.js`

2. Near the end of the file (after line 76), add this test function:

   ```javascript
   it("should clear completed tasks", async () => {
     // New test goes here...
   });
   ```

3. We will add the new test code now:

   ```javascript
   it("should clear completed tasks", async () => {
     // Arrange
     await Todo.create({ task: "Done task 1", completed: true });
     await Todo.create({ task: "Done task 2", completed: true });
     await Todo.create({ task: "Procratinating task", completed: false });

     // Act
     await request(app).post(`/todos/clear-completed`).expect(200);

     // Assert
     const remainingTodos = await Todo.findAll();
     expect(remainingTodos).toHaveLength(1);
     expect(remainingTodos[0].task).toEqual("Procratinating task");
   });
   ```

   - The test code will first **Arrange** the stuff we need before we run the test code. In this case, it is creating a 3 To Do items in the Database first - 2 of which are already marked as completed. We sometimes call this a Data Fixture.
   - Next we will **Act** - by executing the new API endpoint.
   - Lastly, we will **Assert** the result (or side effect) of the action above. After making the API call, the completed tasks should be removed from the Database. As such there should only be 1 To Do item left in the database.

   > **Note:** Remember to save the file.

4. Let's run the test by pressing on the "Play" button tha appears in the left gutter next to your test function.

   ![Complete test code](../images/exercise10/js_2.png)

5. The first time you run this, the test should fail (and it's okay). This is because we have not written any production code yet.

   ![First failing test](../images/exercise10/js_3.png)

   Now we can proceed to add the production code.

### Updating the Code

1. Open the file: `index.js`

2. Near the bottom of the file (after line 75), add this new function:

   ```javascript
   // Delete tasks that has been marked completed
   app.post("/todos/clear-completed", async (req, res) => {
     try {
       await ToDo.destroy({
         where: {
           completed: true,
         },
       });

       res.json({ message: "Completed Tasks Deleted" });
     } catch (err) {
       res.status(500).json({ error: err.message });
     }
   });
   ```

   > **Note:** Remember to save the file.

3. You can now go back to the test file (`test/todoRoutes.test.js`) and rerun the test by clicking on the red "X" icon in the left gutter next to your test function.

   ![](../images/exercise10/js_6.png)

4. Your test should now pass:

   ![Passing test](../images/exercise10/js_7.png)

   And the right panel should also reflect your test run was successful.

   ![](../images/exercise10/js_8.png)

5. To check that you did not introduce any regression bugs, it's a good practice to run the entire test suite to ensure that all the tests are still passing.

   ![Full test suite run - along with the new feature test](../images/exercise10/js_9.png)

### Trying out the new function

1. Start the **"Backend App"** by running the command: `npm run dev`.

2. Open `docs/todo.http` file.

3. Create a few Tasks by sending the `Create new To Do Item` request a few times. Mark the last one as completed (`"completed": true`).

4. Click on the "Send Request" button for the `Clear Completed To Do Items` request.

   ![Send Request](../images/exercise10/http_try.png)

5. When you try to get the list again, there should be no more completed task in the list.

## Python

### Updating the Unit Test

1. In the **"Backend App"** workspace, open the test file: `test_todos.py`

2. Near the end of the file (after line 81), add this test function:

   ```python
   def test_clear_completed_tasks():
       client.post("/todos/", json={"task": "Done task 1", "completed": True})
       client.post("/todos/", json={"task": "Done task 2", "completed": True})
       client.post(
           "/todos/", json={"task": "Procrastinating task", "completed": False})

       response = client.post("/todos/clear-completed")
       assert response.status_code == 200
       assert response.json() == {"message": "Completed Tasks Deleted"}

       response = client.get("/todos")
       assert response.status_code == 200
       data = response.json()
       assert len(data) == 1
       assert data[0]["task"] == "Procrastinating task"
   ```

   - The test code will first **Arrange** the stuff we need before we run the test code. In this case, it is creating a 3 To Do items in the Database first - 2 of which are already marked as completed. We sometimes call this a Data Fixture.
   - Next we will **Act** - by executing the new API endpoint.
   - Lastly, we will **Assert** the result (or side effect) of the action above. After making the API call, the completed tasks should be removed from the Database. As such there should only be 1 To Do item left in the database.

   > **Note:** Remember to save the file.

3. Let's run the test by pressing on the "Play" button tha appears in the left gutter next to your test function.

   ![Complete test code](../images/exercise10/py_1.png)

4. The first time you run this, the test should fail (and it's okay). This is because we have not written any production code yet.

   ![First failing test](../images/exercise10/py_2.png)

   Now we can proceed to add the production code.

### Updating the Code

1. Open the file: `app/crud.py`

2. At the top of file, after line 1, add this new line:

   ```python
   from sqlalchemy import delete
   ```

3. Near the bottom of the file (after line 38), add this new function:

   ```python
   def delete_completed_todos(db: Session):
      stmt = delete(models.TodoItem).where(
          models.TodoItem.completed.__eq__(True))
      db.execute(stmt)
      db.commit()
   ```

   This will add the Clear Completed To Do items functionality to the DB operations.

   > **Note:** Remember to save the file.

4. Next, open the file: `app/main.py` and this this at the end of the file:

   ```python
   @app.post("/todos/clear-completed")
   def clear_completed(db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       crud.delete_completed_todos(db)
       return {"message": "Completed Tasks Deleted"}
   ```

   This will add the API endpoint to clear completed To Do items.

   > **Note:** Remember to save the file.

5. You can now go back to the test file (`test_todos.py`) and rerun the test by clicking on the red "X" icon in the left gutter next to your test function.

   ![](../images/exercise10/py_3.png)

6. Your test should now pass:

   ![Passing test](../images/exercise10/py_4.png)

   And the right panel should also reflect your test run was successful.

   ![](../images/exercise10/py_5.png)

7. To check that you did not introduce any regression bugs, it's a good practice to run the entire test suite to ensure that all the tests are still passing.

   ![Full test suite run - along with the new feature test](../images/exercise10/py_6.png)

### Trying out the new function

1. Start the **"Backend App"** by running the command: `make run`.

2. Open `docs/todo.http` file.

3. Create a few Tasks by sending the `Create new To Do Item` request a few times. Mark the last one as completed (`"completed": true`).

4. Click on the "Send Request" button for the `Clear Completed To Do Items` request.

   ![Send Request](../images/exercise10/http_try.png)

5. When you try to get the list again, there should be no more completed task in the list.

## Java

With the Java implementation, we have quite a number of files to update. We will make the changes from the inside out - starting with the **Repository**, then the **Service**, and finally the **Controller** integration test.

### Updating the Repository

1. In the **"Backend App"** workspace, open the test file: `src/main/java/com/tddworkshops/todolist/repository/TodoRepository.java`

2. In the interfacce class, add this line:

   ```java
   void deleteCompleted();
   ```

   This will add the method to delete all completed To Do items.

   > **Note:** Remember to save the file.

3. Next we add the unit test to check this behavior. Open the test file: `src/test/java/com/tddworkshops/todolist/repository/TodoRepositoryTest.java`

4. In the `TodoRepositoryTest` class (add a new line after line 32), add this test function:

   ```java
   @Test
    void whenDeletedByCompleted_thenReturnAllUnclearedTodos() {
        // Arrange
        Todo task1 = new Todo(null, "Incomplete Task", false);
        Todo task2 = new Todo(null, "Completed Task", true);
        todoRepository.save(task1);
        todoRepository.save(task2);

        // Act - Remove all completed tasks
        todoRepository.deleteByCompleted(true);

        // Assert
        List<Todo> todoList = todoRepository.findAll();
        assertThat(todoList).hasSize(1);
        assertThat(todoList.get(0).getTask()).isEqualTo("Incomplete Task");

        // Act - Remove all incomplete tasks
        todoRepository.deleteByCompleted(false);

        // Assert
        todoList = todoRepository.findAll();
        assertThat(todoList).hasSize(0);
    }
   ```

   - The test code will first **Arrange** the stuff we need before we run the test code. In this case, it is creating a 2 To Do items in the Database first - 1 of which are already marked as completed. We sometimes call this a Data Fixture.
   - Next we will **Act** - by executing the new method.
   - Lastly, we will **Assert** the result (or side effect) of the action above. After making the API call, the completed tasks should be removed from the Database. As such there should only be 1 To Do item left in the database.

   > **Note:** Remember to save the file.

5. Let's run the test by pressing on the "Play" button tha appears in the left gutter next to your test function.

   ![Complete test code](../images/exercise10/java_1.png)

6. That unit test should pass.

   ![Passing test](../images/exercise10/java_2.png)

### Updating the Service

1. Let's use the new **Repository** method in the **Service**. Open the file: `src/main/java/com/tddworkshops/todolist/service/TodoService.java`

2. In the `TodoService` class, add this new method:

   ```java
   @Transactional
   public void clearCompletedTodos() {
       todoRepository.deleteByCompleted(true);
   }
   ```

   - This will add the method to clear all completed To Do items.
   - You might see an error with the `@Transactional` annotation. You can hover your cursor on the error, click on **"Quick Fix"**, and select **"Import Tranactional (org.springframework.transaction.annotation)"**.
   - Or you can fix this by adding the following import statement at the top of the file:

     ```java
     import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional;
     ```

   > **Note:** Remember to save the file.

3. As this new method is only 1 line, and we have already tested the functionality in the **Repository** test, we do not need to add a new test for this method.

### Updating the Controller

1. Let's use the new **Service** method in the **Controller**. Open the file: `src/main/java/com/tddworkshops/todolist/controller/TodoController.java`

2. In the `TodoController` class, add this new method:

   ```java
   @PostMapping("/clear-completed")
   public ResponseEntity<String> clearCompletedTodos() {
       todoService.clearCompletedTodos();
       return ResponseEntity.ok("Completed Tasks Deleted");
   }
   ```

   - This will add the API endpoint to clear completed To Do items.

   > **Note:** Remember to save the file.

3. Next, we update our Intgeration test to check this behavior. Open the file: `src/test/java/com/tddworkshops/todolist/TodolistApplicationTests.java`

4. Add these 2 new code block to the `test_create_todo()` test.

   ```java
   // Create completed task
   	webTestClient.post()
   			.uri("/todos")
   			.contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
   			.bodyValue("{\"task\": \"Completed Task\", \"completed\": true}")
   			.exchange()
   			.expectStatus()
   			.isOk();

   	// Validate cleared completed tasks
   	webTestClient.post()
   			.uri("/todos/clear-completed")
   			.exchange()
   			.expectStatus()
   			.isOk()
   			.expectBody(String.class)
   			.isEqualTo("Completed Tasks Deleted");
   ```

5. Next we run the test by pressing on the "Play" button tha appears in the left gutter next to your test function.

   ![Complete test code](../images/exercise10/java_3.png)

6. That unit test should pass.

   ![Passing test](../images/exercise10/java_4.png)

### Trying out the new function

1. Start the **"Backend App"**.

2. Open `docs/todo.http` file.

3. Create a few Tasks by sending the `Create new To Do Item` request a few times. Mark the last one as completed (`"completed": true`).

4. Click on the "Send Request" button for the `Clear Completed To Do Items` request.

   ![Send Request](../images/exercise10/http_try.png)

5. When you try to get the list again, there should be no more completed task in the list.

### Refactoring

1. You'll notice that the API response from the `/clear-completed` endpoint is just a simple message. We can refactor this to return a JSON object instead.

2. First, let's update the Integration test to check for the new JSON response. Open the file: `src/test/java/com/tddworkshops/todolist/TodolistApplicationTests.java`

3. Update the test code block to check for the new JSON response:

   ```java
   // Validate cleared completed tasks
   webTestClient.post()
           .uri("/todos/clear-completed")
           .exchange()
           .expectStatus()
           .isOk()
           .expectBody()
           .jsonPath("$.message").isEqualTo("Completed Tasks Deleted");
   ```

4. Run the Integration test by pressing on the "Play" button that appears in the left gutter next to your test function.
   ![Run test code](../images/exercise10/java_3.png)

5. The last portion of the test should fail.

   ![ code](../images/exercise10/java_5.png)

6. Next, open the file: `src/main/java/com/tddworkshops/todolist/controller/TodoController.java`.

7. Update the `clearCompletedTodos` method to return a JSON object instead of a String:

   ```java
   @PostMapping("/clear-completed")
   public ResponseEntity<Map<String, String>> clearCompletedTodos() {
       todoService.clearCompletedTodos();
       return ResponseEntity.ok(Map.of("message", "Completed Tasks Deleted"));
   }
   ```

   - We changed the `ResponseEntity` to return a `Map<String, String>` object.
   - We use the `Map.of` method to create a new Map object with the key-value pair of `message` and `Completed Tasks Deleted`.
   - You might see an error with the `Map` method. You can hover your cursor on the error, click on **"Quick Fix"**, and select **"Import Map (java.util)"**.

8. Run the Integration test again. It should now pass.

9. Run all the tests to ensure that everything is still working as expected.
